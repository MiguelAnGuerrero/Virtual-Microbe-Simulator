# Virtual-Microbe-Simulator
Worked with a team during Colorado State University Create-a-thon to make a virtual microbe simulator. The application was intended to make the study of microbes more assessable for a teaching environment. I was tasked with producing the initial scene using Unity and C#. Our team won the Outstanding Artistry Award.
